GPUs are similiar to CPUs in the sense that they are both silicon based microprocessors mounted on a pcb with somefrom of cooling attatched
But their microarcitecture is fundamentally different, A CPU is designed to minimise memory access latency
which is ideal for computing a read address and getitng the results back
wheras a GPU is designed to tolerate latency and maximize the amount of data that can be accessed a sceond.

Thus CPU's are optimised to finish a task as quick as possible with the smallest latency, while still being able to quickly switch between operations.
A CPU's nature is all about processing tasks in a serialized way.

This contrasts with a GPU which is optimised to get the maximum throughput, allowing it to push as many tasks as posbile throught its internals at once. It does this through task parallisation (more on that later)
